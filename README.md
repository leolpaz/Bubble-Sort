# Bubble Sort

On this project I'll do a bubble sort algorithm, which is a very basic way to let a computer sort something, due to the inneficiency of the algorithm it's not usually used in actual projects, working more as a learning tool.
A bubble sort algorithm is an algorithm that sorts an array working through the array and comparing it with the item immediately in front and swapping if needed.

Like this:
